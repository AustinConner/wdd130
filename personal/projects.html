                <h1>Automating Windows Installations With WDS and MDT</h1>
                <p>At work, we've been imaging computers manually. It's a process that takes a fair amount of time and I wanted to find out if there was a way to automate it. This project is a work in progress.</p>

                <h1>Better Documentation</h1>
                <p>At work, our documentation is all kept in a very fun (downright horrible) shared network drive. This documentation is nothing short from miserable to navigate, so I found a static site generator called Hugo which allows users to create documentaion using simple markdown which can be rendered on my computer and either deployed to the server or put onto the company drive to be accessed later.</p>
