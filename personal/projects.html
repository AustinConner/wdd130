                <h1>Automating Windows Setup</h1>
                <p>At work, we've been configuring computers manually. It's a process that takes a fair amount of time and I wanted to find out if there was a way to automate it. What I've been experimenting with is called Windows Configuration Designer (WCD). You use it to create a .ppkg file and put that file on your thumb drive and when you get to the Out of Box Experience, you plug in the flash drive, and it grabs the configuration package. </p>
                <p>I currently have a (WIP) ppkg file that adds a run-once registry key to the computer that runs a script that gets transfered, creates and admin account, and then runs a script to transfer files to the C:\program_data folder. Once it gets done with itself, it takes you to the windows desktop. The run-once key causes a .batch file with all of the installers silent installation parameters and installs the programs one by one. In about 15-20 minutes, setup is mostly complete. I'm still trying to automate more of the standard workflow.</p>

                <h1>Better Documentation</h1>
                <p>At work, our documentation is all kept in a very fun (downright horrible) shared network drive. This documentation is nothing short from miserable to navigate, so I found a static site generator called Hugo which allows users to create documentation using simple markdown which can be rendered on my computer and either deployed to the server or put onto the company drive to be accessed later. Those HTML files can be indexed and then searched for using a plugin within hugo on a static webpage. This allows for better search funtionality and allows end users to better find what they are looking for.</p>
