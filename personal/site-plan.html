        Hey! My name is Austin Conner. I’m an IT Professional currently studying Computer Information Technology at Brigham Young University Idaho. Welcome to my personal website! I’ll use this website to show off all the cool things that I’m up to, as well as some cool things I’ve already accomplished.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Austin Conner. I grew up in a small town called Valley Point in the wild and wonderful state of West Virginia. I graduated from Preston High School in 2021 and wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life. Fast forward a couple months, I started college at West Virginia University (WVU) in Morgantown, West Virginia. I got a job working at Best Buy with the Geek Squad and I guess you can say that’s when I figured out what I wanted to do. WVU didn’t really have the program that I wanted to do, but a satellite campus of the university did… Or so I thought. I transferred to Potomac State college of West Viriginia University which was 2 hours away from there. I got into the classroom, and it just didn’t scratch my itch for wanting to learn new technology. I met this cute girl playing ping pong in the student rec-center and we decided to talk and go on a walk. Fast forward 6 months, we’re married, and I joined the Church of Jesus Christ and we both weren’t getting out needs satisfied from the school. We decided to transfer to Brigham Young University Idaho in hopes of a more challenging and fulfilling education.  transferred to Best Buy in Idaho Falls and worked as a sale associate for a couple months until I recently got a job as a help desk technician at Madison Memorial Hospital in Rexburg Idaho. It’s been a wild ride, but here we are! I’m more than excited to gain more skills so I can continue to bless others in ways I never thought was possible.

      <h3>My Projects</h3>
      <p>
        At work, we have a lot of computers that need to be deployed and not a streamlined process to get them done. We have to go through each device manually to get it up and running. After some research, I learned that I can use windows deployment server and windows development toolkit to PXE boot a machine and pretty much automate everything. I haven’t made it too far yet through, I’m hung up creating an Active Directory server so I can have it as close to the environment we have at work without actually having it. The idea is that we plug the device into the network and boot it off of it, then we can give the computer a name so we can find it in our RMM. Once the device is named, it’ll join the domain and install a few essential applications to inferface with the rmm. Once we have it on the domain and connected to the rmm, we can use the rmm to install the rest of the applications silently. Hopefully cutting down the deployment time for devices from 1 hour to just 2 minutes or so.
