                        <p>Graduated from Preston High School in Kingwood, West Virginia. May 2021</p>
                        <p>I started college at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia.<br>I then transfered to Potomac State College of West Virginia University to study Computer Infomation Systems.</p>
                        <p>I very quickly realized this WAS NOT the school for me.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University Idaho studying Computer Infomation Technology.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>I met my beautiful wife Sherea while I was at Potomac State College playing ping pong!</p>
                        <p>I decided to go to a chruch service with her one Sunday and learned what the Chruch was all about.</p>
                        <p>I talked to the missionaries and learned more about the gospel.</p>
                        <p>I was baptized the following March of 2023 and I have been happily walking down the covenant path ever since.</p>
                        <p>Sherea and I moved to Rexburg Idaho in September of 2023 and have been here since then. We have grown to love the town and the people who call this place home.</p>
