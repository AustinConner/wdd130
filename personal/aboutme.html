                My name is Austin Conner. I grew up in a small town called Valley Point in the wild and wonderful state of West Virginia. I graduated from Preston High School in 2021 and wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life. Fast forward a couple months, I started college at West Virginia University (WVU) in Morgantown, West Virginia. I got a job working at Best Buy with the Geek Squad and I guess you can say that’s when I figured out what I wanted to do. WVU didn’t really have the program that I wanted to do, but a satellite campus of the university did… Or so I thought. I transferred to Potomac State college of West Viriginia University which was 2 hours away from there. I got into the classroom, and it just didn’t scratch my itch for wanting to learn new technology. I met this cute girl playing ping pong in the student rec-center and we decided to talk and go on a walk. Fast forward 6 months, we’re married, and I joined the Church of Jesus Christ and we both weren’t getting out needs satisfied from the school. We decided to transfer to Brigham Young University Idaho in hopes of a more challenging and fulfilling education. transferred to Best Buy in Idaho Falls and worked as a sale associate for a couple months until I recently got a job as a help desk technician at Madison Memorial Hospital in Rexburg Idaho. It’s been a wild ride, but here we are! I’m more than excited to gain more skills so I can continue to bless others in ways I never thought was possible.
